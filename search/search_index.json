At the time there was not a lot of large format 3D printers on the market and none at a affordable price. Especially no open source (fully or in part). Even to this date the Prometheus MSLA project is the only fully open sourse resin printer. The project aimed to create a similar priced machine as the competition with good performance and give the user full control and ownership of their machine. Nothing will be locked, everything is upgradeable, repairable and more !</p> <p>After a failed kickstarter at the end of 2021 the contrapposto shop team didnt stop the project and took an other direction. Everything was for the best ! A complete redesign of the machine, new electronics and futur plans were on the table.

Because the Prometheus MSLA is fully open source other screens can be installed by the user for more pixels, different size, dual screen and more ! The only thing you need is a compatible HDMI driver board for your LCD because a lot of other screen (like the ones from Chitu) run on propriatary protocole.

With that in mind we suggest that all parts that may/will be in contact with resin be printed in a compatible or resistant material. There is also a big selection of blends or \"plus\" filaments that may not be compatible also. We suggest making tests with resin to see the impact on your filament.</p> <p>The material  we suggest is PLA and PC due to its strong and stiff property. It also resists very well to the chemicals inside the composition of resin.
