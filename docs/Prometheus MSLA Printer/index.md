<h3>The Prometheus MSLA Printer</h3>
<p>The Prometheus MSLA printer is the first fully open source MSLA (resin) printer. Our team is from all around the world with a big community that helps in one way or an other on this project.</p>

<p>To know more about all the parts you need to buy and print, refer to our github repository where the BOM is listed with all the links (they are affeliates so make sure to use them as much as possible to support this project). This build is not particularly difficult to build compared to other similar project. You will need a basic knowledge in electronics but IF YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS OR ASK A PROFESSIONAL BECAUSE YOU WILL HANDLE MAIN VOLTAGE. Make sure to visit our Discord server a member of the team or the community can help with your questions.</p>

For the programing we have set up a "one click" install with all the configuration needed for the machine.</p>
