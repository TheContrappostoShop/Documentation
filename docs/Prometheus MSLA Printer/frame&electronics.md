<h3>First parts of the frame</h3>
<p>There is few way you can assemble the Frame. First there is hidden connectors. If you have limited access to tools and you have'nt order from one of our suppliers this could be an option. An other way to do it "RECOMMENDED" is with the blind joints using M5 OR M6x12 BHC (depending on your extrusion profil). Our suppliers uses M6 screws.

We recommend to follow the steps so the assembly can go smoothly.</p>

<h3>Base plate and electronics bay</h3>

<p>We recommend doing the most of the electronic assembly outside the frame because it will become very tight later.
First mount the braket on your power supply using the appropriate screws.</p>
