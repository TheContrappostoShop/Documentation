<h3>Hey there!ðŸ‘‹</h3> 

<p>We're a group of people from around the globe, based in Canda.<br>
Our project is the Prometheus mSLA printer, a resin printer that aims to be fully open-source.</p>

<p>This consists of:
<ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/Prometheus-MSLA">CAD</a></li>
    <li>The <a href="https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/Apollo">Apollo Controller Board</a></li>
    <li>The <a href="https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/PrometheusOS">Custom OS</a></li>
    <li>The Backend<a href="https://github.com/TheContrappostoShop/Odyssey">Odyssey</a></li>
    <li>The Frontend (WIP)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>We're aiming to stay as true to open-source as possible! As this is a WIP effort,<br>
not all Licenses might be abiding by the requirements at all times.</p>
