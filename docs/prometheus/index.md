### The Prometheus MSLA Printer
The Prometheus MSLA printer is the first fully open source MSLA (resin) printer. Our team is from all around the world with a big community that helps in one way or an other on this project.

To know more about all the parts you need to buy and print, refer to our github repository where the BOM is listed with all the links (they are affeliates so make sure to use them as much as possible to support this project). This build is not particularly difficult to build compared to other similar project. You will need a basic knowledge in electronics but IF YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS OR ASK A PROFESSIONAL BECAUSE YOU WILL HANDLE MAIN VOLTAGE. Make sure to visit our Discord server a member of the team or the community can help with your questions.

For the programing we have set up a "one click" install with all the configuration needed for the machine.

### History of the Project
The Prometheus project began in 2020 with the work of the original founders Samuel Boutin and Melissa Belanger (The Contrapposto Shop). At the time there was not a lot of large format 3D printers on the market and none at a affordable price. Especially no open source (fully or in part). Even to this date the Prometheus MSLA project is the only fully open sourse resin printer. The project aimed to create a similar priced machine as the competition with good performance and give the user full control and ownership of their machine. Nothing will be locked, everything is upgradeable, repairable and more !

After a failed kickstarter at the end of 2021 the contrapposto shop team didnt stop the project and took an other direction. Everything was for the best ! A complete redesign of the machine, new electronics and futur plans were on the table. New members for the Prometheus project started to join and contribute for an even better machine !
