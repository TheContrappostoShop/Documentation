### Frame Assembly

??? info "Connecting your extrusions"

    There are a handful of different ways to assemble the frame sections:
    Hidden Connectors, which are easier to use if you have limited access to tools, or Blind Joints, which require additional holes to be drilled, and for the ends of the extrusions to be tapped. Most Prometheus Kit Suppliers provide extrusions prepared for Blind Joints. 

We recommend assembling your frame in the following order, to ensure a smooth process:

#### Corner Extrusions

Slide the base plate (with all of the components affixed in the [electronics section](./electronics.md)) and fix it in place. The motherboard will need to have spacer under it if you bought a Prometheus kit.
