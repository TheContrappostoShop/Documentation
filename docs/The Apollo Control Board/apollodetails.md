<h2>Apollo Control Board Details</h2>
<p>The Apollo motherboard is based on the RP2040 ARM cortex-M0+ microcontroller and it has<br>
been created for 3D printers ( especially mSLA type ). Itâ€™s a carrier board for the Raspberry pi 4B<br>
but can carry other types of SBC with adapters ( coming soon ). As is, it can support 3 stepper<br>
motors for multiple axes and 3 limit switches for them. One power mosfet for power hungry<br>
components like led array or heating bed, with the trigger output to activate an SSR or <br>
something else if needed. Finally 3x2 12vdc PWM compatible outputs for fans and accessories.</p>
