It\u2019s a carrier board for the Raspberry pi 4B but can carry other types of SBC with adapters ( coming soon ). As is, it can support 3 stepper motors for multiple axes and 3 limit switches for them. One power mosfet for power hungry components like led array or heating bed, with the trigger output to activate an SSR or  something else if needed. Finally 3x2 12vdc PWM compatible outputs for fans and accessories.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"The%20Apollo%20Control%20Board/apollooverview/","title":"Apollo Control Board Overview","text":"<p>The Prometheus MSLA controller board (Apollo) is the official controller/motherboard for the Prometheus MSLA printer.

The communication and power transfer for the pi is made via spring pins ( pogo pins ). They connect to pads under the pi for a seamless interface. The pogo pins are very fragile and precise components so some of the pads on the pi need to be modified for a good connection, and to reduce the risk of breaking them.</p> Step1 <p>With a good pair of flush cutters, cut the first 3 pins of the GPIO pins as flush as possible. These pins are #2 - 4 - 6 (5V - 5V - GND )</p> <p></p> Step2 (optional) <p>With a small file or a soldering iron smooth the surface of these cut pins so the pogo pins can have better contact on the pads.</p> <p></p> <p>It should look something like this.</p> Step3 <p>With a sharp point or a soldering iron, scrape or heat the contact test pads. This  procedure will ensure to remove any potential oxide layer that can prevent the pogo pins from having a good connection to the pi. *The important pads are ( TP17, TP10, TP6 )</p> <p> </p> Step4 <p>You can now carefully install the pi on the board using the 4 M2.5 screws. Don\u2019t over tighten the screws to prevent crushing the pogo pins (look at them while screwing). * We strongly suggest installing a proper heatsink on your pi.</p> <p></p>"}]}
